Date: February 28th, 2023

***About:***
For this project I wanted to develop an interactive program that will determine if a single borrower will qualify for a mortgage. this is based on debt to income ratio, fico score, and loan to value. If the borrower qualifies I will first return the monthly principal and interest payment. Then I will return the total monthly payment which includes taxes, insurance. An amortization schedule will also be created for the borrower. 

***Goal:***
The goal of this project is to develop a transparent application for potential borrower's to use before applying for a mortgage. 

***How to Run:***
Download the main and ConventionalMortgage java files and run.
